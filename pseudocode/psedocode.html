JS CODE

define player 
define player position with x y

how fast should the snake move?
- define fallspeed
- movement speed

Will the snake jump obstacles?
- define jumping as true or false
- define jumping speed if true

MAKE SCORE BORD

function startGame () or 
snakegame.start();

-Need a function to set the food out for the snake 


*NEED A LOOP
