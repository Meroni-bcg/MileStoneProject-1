<!--<title>Snake Game</title>

    Create a username and password 
Background color (canvas) make it into a display block


get image for snake food (mouse?)

get image for snake --Background (grass or out doors layout)

possibly add audio when snake eats and gets larger
    - add short audio when snake goes left and right
    - add longer audio when snake dies

SCORE: 
    - Top left of screen keeps score
    - When you reach a score of 5 (maybe snake changes color?)
    - To win your snake has to go through each color of the rainbow (R,O,Y,G,B,P)
    - You win at 30 points
    - If snake hits a border you revert to being a gray snake & lose all points


JS CODE

define player
define player position with x y

how fast should the snake move?
- define fallspeed

Will the snake jump obstacles?
- define jumping as true or false
- define jumping speed if true

MAKE SCORE BORD
- name your score bord. maybe something like, myScore , scoreLabel, drawScore..
- should the player start at 0? let score=0;
define your score board. let myScore;


Think of how to CODE a function to BEGIN THE GAME

function startGame () or 
snakegame.start();
